# Write a method, scalar_multiple!(array, multiplier), that accepts an array and a number as args. 
# The method should mutate the given array by multiplying all of the elements by the multiplier.
# The method should return the given array.
# 
# Note: this method must MUTATE the input array. This means that the object_id of the input array should be identical
# to the object_id of the returned array. The exact object_ids you get back don't matter. We just want the ids
# to be the same before and after calling your method.
